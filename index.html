  		<p>I'm a new web developer, who likes to bring an abundance of fun and determination to projects. All while learning new techniques and methods, there is always something new to learn or a skill to improve upon.</p>

  		<p>Family to me is very important -- because family is always there for you through thick and thin.</p>
